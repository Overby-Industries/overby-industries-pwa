        For all my life propulsion and it's fuel has stifled my SSTO Heavy Lift Shuttle design, but no longer. 
        Project Helga, offically known as SSTO-44 Starlifter II will be powered by a revolutionary new propulsion system that combines the best of both organic chemical and electric propulsion technologies.
        The propulsion will be a revolutionary new era in aviation rivialing the impact of the jet engine on aviation in the 20th century, and will be a key enabler for the rapid deployment of payloads to orbit and beyond.
        Project Helga's propulsion is a dual mode ABEP (Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion) ion thrusters, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) electric plasma scramjet hybrid system utilizing ionic liquids for propellent and Lorentz forces, which allows for efficient flight at both subsonic and hypersonic speeds.
        The MHD electric plasma scramjet is a key component of the propulsion system, providing the necessary thrust for hypersonic flight using ionic liquid afterburners. While the ABEP ion thrusters provide efficient propulsion for subsonic flight and are used for orbital maneuvers and in-space propulsion.
        Our ABEP ion thrusters will also be able to utilise solar wind capture for in-space propulsion, allowing for extended missions beyond Earth's orbit without the need for carrying large amounts of propellant.
        The combination of these two propulsion technologies allows for a versatile and efficient propulsion system that can adapt to the changing flight conditions of Project Helga, making it an ideal choice for a powered flight SSTO Heavy Lift Shuttle.

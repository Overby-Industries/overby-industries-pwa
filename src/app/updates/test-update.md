Today we officially began lab testing of our **ionic liquid power unit prototype**.

- ✅ Conducted initial arc stabilization tests  
- ✅ Verified ionic fluid thermal stability to 400°C  
- ✅ Confirmed capacitor discharge cycling  

This milestone marks the first step toward powering **Starlifter II** and our autonomous miners.  
Next phase: scaled plasma chamber test in simulated vacuum.
